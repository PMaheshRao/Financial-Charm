# Financial Charm

Designed a desktop-based application 
which can be used by Customers for ATM Related 
Transactions using Java and used MySQL for the database 
to simulate the common functions of using a bank account.

 Used Java Swing to create a GUI that supports 
 actions such as creating an account, deposit, withdraw, etc.
  Implemented object-oriented programming practices such as 
  inheritance to create different account types.

  I did this project in group.
