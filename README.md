# Financial-Charm

Designed a desktop-based application which can be used by Customers for ATM Related Transactions using Java and used MySQL for the database to simulate the common functions of using a bank account. Used Java Swing to create a GUI that supports actions such as creating an account, deposit, withdraw, etc. Implemented object-oriented programming practices such as inheritance to create different account types.

I created this project in gorup.
